# Challenge10
Module10 Unsupervised Learning

Aim: The goal is to create a Jupyter notebook to understand segementation/clusters of cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. These results are plotted to visually show the performance with and without optimization techniques such as PCA (principal component analysis).

Data: CSV file provided for this Challenge contains the price change data of cryptocurrencies in different periods.

Code: The starter code file has the final code to complete the tasks outlined below:

Import the Data 
Prepare the Data 
Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data
Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
Visualize and Compare the Results

Optimizing the data for the features that make most impact (PCA components) doesnt seem to effect the K-means. The optimization helps to look at the entire dataset vs no optimization is only looking at two specific columns in the dataset.
